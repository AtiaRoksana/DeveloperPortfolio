            <p>I can understand that becuase the feeling of discovering a great article is similar to finding gold in a
                salt-mine. The internet is full of tutorials and resources, but not all of them are good, and with such
                huge
                numbers, it has become increasingly difficult to find good resources, or should I call the gem of
                articles,
                which everybody wants to read.</p>

            <h2>Become a Web Developer</h2>
            <p>Coding Horror is a blog by Jeff Atwood, an experienced web developer. Although, the blog consists of all
                types of security and software development related topics, Jeff personally concentrates on the human
                participation in software development. The author firmly believes that one also needs to focus on the
                people who are going to use the code and understand them while preparing the code.</p>
